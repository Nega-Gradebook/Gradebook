#Gradebook#
_an app to foster openness between students, parents, and educators._

Gradebook is an app designed to create transparency between teachers, pupils, and
their families about individual student progression. At Gradebook we recognize that it can be difficult at times for parents to troubleshoot gaps in their children's education when progress reports are the only method for gauging comprehension. Our app strives to open a channel of observation that allows for pinpointing problem areas of understanding before it is too late.

As educators collect assignments from their students over the length of a course Gradebook allows them to catalogue, edit, and make final grades available to both the student and parent. Please contact your local administrator to recieve login credentials to get started with Gradebook.

Please feel free to visit our app at _HEROKU LINK_ for a working version of program.
